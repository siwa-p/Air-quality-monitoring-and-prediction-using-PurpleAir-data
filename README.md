# Air Quality: Machine learning models applied to air quality data
In this project, I will attempt to construct a predictive model for air-quality monitoring from data obtained from cheap air-sensors by PurpleAir and various meteorological data. I will use purpleAir API to gather data in a region(to be decided) for a period of time. 

An application will be build that will let users visualize the data, the model and itâ€™s predictions.
